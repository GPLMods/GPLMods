            <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
            <p>GPL Mods provides a platform for users to download and share user-created modifications ("Mods") for various software. You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone else's use and enjoyment of the Service.</p>
            
            <h2>2. User-Generated Content</h2>
            <p>You are solely responsible for the content you upload, post, or otherwise transmit via the Service. By uploading a Mod, you represent and warrant that you have the right to do so and that it does not violate any laws or third-party rights.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You grant GPL Mods a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, host, store, reproduce, and distribute the content you submit for the purposes of operating and providing the Service.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right, but not the obligation, to review and remove any user-generated content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates these Terms or our community guidelines.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Prohibited Conduct</h2>

                <li>Infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Please see our DMCA Policy for reporting copyright infringement.</li>
                <li>Engage in any activity that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of the Service.</li>
                <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Service or its related systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

            <p>GPL Mods does not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. We do not test or endorse every Mod and cannot guarantee their functionality, safety, or legality. You download and use Mods at your own risk.</p>

            <p><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, GPL Mods shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages... [etc.]</strong></p>
            <!-- Abridged for brevity, but you would include all sections -->
            
            <h2>6. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.</p>
