                <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
                <p>GPL Mods provides a platform for users to download and share user-created modifications ("Mods") for mobile applications and games. You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone else's use and enjoyment of the Service.</p>
                
                <h2>2. User-Generated Content</h2>
                <p>You are solely responsible for the content you upload, post, or otherwise transmit via the Service. By uploading a Mod, you represent and warrant that you have the right to do so and that it does not violate any laws or third-party rights.</p>
